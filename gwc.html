              In 1984, 37% of computer science graduates were women
              By 2014, that number had dropped to 18%

              <br><strong>We need more women in computer science.</strong>

              <em>My</em> epiphany came during 7th grade math class when we had a 2-week unit on programming in Python.<strong> I discovered that I liked coding... and I was GOOD at it.</strong>

              I started a Girls Who Code Club at my school during the 2018&ndash;2019 school year. <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/" target="_blank">Girls Who Code</a> is a national organization whose goal is to close the gender gap and encourage more girls to pursue computer science and technology.
            </p>

            <p>
              As the Club’s leader, I plan the topics and materials for meetings, coordinate with school faculty, reach out to local universities and companies to arrange visits, manage communications with club members, and lead the actual meetings.
            </p>

            <p>
              I’m leading the club again this year, and recruited 18 girls during our recent club fair sign-up day. I even had a number of boys sign up!

              Last year, we focused on learning to code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and used our skills to create web sites. We also had a meeting on computer hardware where we took apart computers, identified components, and put the machines back together again.
            </p>

            <p>
              This year, we’re further exploring computer science and technology by bringing in guest speakers and going on field trips to <a href="https://cc.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Georgia Tech’s College of Computing</a> and Atlanta-area technology companies.
