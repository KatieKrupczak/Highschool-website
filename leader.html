              “A leader... is like a shepherd. He stays behind the flock, letting the most nimble go out ahead, where upon the others follow, not realizing that all along they are being directed from behind.” 
              <br> - Nelson Mandela

              I aspire to always be a Servant Leader&mdash;one who leads from behind, who empowers others around her, who digs in and starts working instead of standing around giving orders, whose goal is the good of the group, not the glory of the leader, and one who models leadership to develop future leaders to replace her after she’s gone.
            </p>
            <p>
              Formal training and leadership experience through Scouts, BSA (Boy Scouts of America) have taught me to be a servant leader. I’m proud to be the founding Senior Patrol Leader for Troop 19, (the first girl troop at my school), and I’m proud to be the founder and student leader for my school’s chapter of Girls Who Code. My skills in conflict-resolution, work group dynamics, and servant leadership serve me well in other leadership positions, as well.
